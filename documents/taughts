- The reason we code our serializers inside our APIs is the serializer is meant to do only one job,
converting data structures. It's not going to write anything in our database (which is considered our
business logic). Due to this, We place our serializer in the heart of its own API so we could implement
our onion architecture in a more professional way and once we want to modify an API, its serializer is also
right in front of us and we don't have to look for it in other places.

- Selectors are used to select and display something (read) from the database and services are used to add data
(write) to the database.
